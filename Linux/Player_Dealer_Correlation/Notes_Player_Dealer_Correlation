I believe the player Mylie Schmidt worked in collaboration with the dealer Billy Jones in order to steal money from Lucky Duck Casino.

As can be seen in the notes from Player and Dealer Analyis, these were the only people present at all of the losses on those days.
It can be fair to assume that this then is the extent of the operation and no greater conspiracy was in progress.
